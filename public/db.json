		"para_A": "You have a Low Self-Esteem. People with Low Self Esteem tend to devalue themselves. There can be many reasons for Low Self-Esteem. But what really matters are that you start believing in yourself. Here are some ways to Overcome it: 1. Live in the moment When you are focused on the moment, you can choose your actions consciously and wisely, unaffected by the hurts of your past and unconcerned by worries or hopes about the future. 2. Be aware of your emotions When we’re aware, we can recognise how we are responding and reacting to our own fears, creating a moment between our emotions and our actions. 3. Write your thoughts in a journal when struggling with low self-esteem Many of our thoughts and feelings are locked in our subconscious mind and writing can help to bring them into our awareness. Writing about the way we feel and think can help to separate negative ideas about ourselves from the truth of who we really are. 4. Be non-judgemental when your self-esteem is low Low self-esteem often arises from judging yourself far too harshly. When we approach our lives non-judgementally, we simply accept ourselves, our experiences, our failures and successes and other people just as they are, neither good or bad, without pride or shame. 5. Stay connected to yourself to be more confident Mindfulness is when you focus your attention and awareness on the present moment, free from both internal and external distractions. By practicing mindfulness regularly, can help you to develop a sense of connection to yourself.",
		"para_B": "Self-Neutrality to Achieve Self-Love “[Neutral self-talk] isn't positive or negative, but rather, objective….just stick to the facts.” — REBECCA OGLE, LCSW Neutral self-talk is steeped in reality. “It isn’t positive or negative, but rather, objective,” Ogle says. “When trying to think of neutral self-talk, just stick to the facts.” Here are some examples she provided: • I’m doing the best I can right now. • Sometimes I fail at things, and other times I succeed. • There are things I don’t like about my body, and other things I do like about it. • I’m no better or worse than anyone else. I’m drawn to this shift in thinking because it allows us to acknowledge our bad days (or bad feelings) with honesty, instead of disregard. It gives us enough time to honor our emotions, but not enough time to wallow in them. “Healthy self-esteem comes when who you are on the inside and who you are on the outside are aligned.” Although you have neutral Self Esteem, Does not mean it is Balanced and Healthy. The correct balance comes when you work for it, be true to Yourself. HERE ARE SOME TIPS FOR A BALANCED, HEALTHY SELF-IMAGE 1. Do not allow other people to bring you down. 2. Keep your circle of trusted friends positive. 3. Reward yourself when you have a job well done. 4. Take set-backs in stride, try again. 5. Work hard at the things you ARE good at. For many people a healthy self-esteem is a constant battle. If you feel like you battle with your self-image on a regular basis or you are afraid to try anything new, you are not alone. Just the fact that you have tried this quiz and read this far shows that you want to improve yourself. ",
		"para_C": "You have High Self-Esteem Having a High Self- Esteem is all about how high you perceive yourself.

Over-Confidence can also lead to more problems which is why you need a balance for your Self-Esteem. Here are some Pros and Cons for Self Esteem. Pros of high self-esteem 1. Better mental health and well-being 2. Assertiveness and being true to yourself 3. Greater resilience 4. Improved social skills and healthier relationships 5. Greater motivation and productivity 6. More likely to succeed 7. Better physical health Are there any cons of high self-esteem? 1. Arrogance and self-esteem 2. Narcissism and self-esteem 3. Overly high self-esteem may also be associated with other unhelpful traits and behaviours, such as being over-confident, pompous, impatient, insensitive, or materialistic. However, having high self-esteem does not necessarily lead to an inflated ego, poor self-awareness, or warped sense of self. But if you struggle with these issues, a mental health professional can guide you on discovering yourself and building a healthy sense of self. "
